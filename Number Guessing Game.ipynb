    "- The program should ask the user for their name and refer to the user by name for the duration of the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The user should be prompted for a guess in a predefined interval that is provided to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The user should be continuously prompted for guesses until they guess the correct answer.\n",

    "- The user should be provided with feedback about the guess (whether it's too high or low).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The user should also be notified if the guess is outside the allowable range.\n",
